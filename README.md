# ConvDepth
We are submitting IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS (T-ITS), please wait for updates on the details.
##  setup

We ran our experiments with PyTorch 1.8.0, CUDA 11.1, Python 3.6 and Ubuntu 20.04.

##  Dataset

This is from monodepth2 (http://www.github.com/nianticlabs/monodepth2)

You can download the entire [raw KITTI dataset](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/raw_data.php) by running:
```shell
wget -i splits/kitti_archives_to_download.txt -P kitti_data/
```
Then unzip with
```shell
cd kitti_data
unzip "*.zip"
cd ..
```
**Warning:** it weighs about **175GB**, so make sure you have enough space to unzip too!

Our default settings expect that you have converted the png images to jpeg with this command, **which also deletes the raw KITTI `.png` files**:
```shell
find kitti_data/ -name '*.png' | parallel 'convert -quality 92 -sampling-factor 2x2,1x1,1x1 {.}.png {.}.jpg && rm {}'
```
**or** you can skip this conversion step and train from raw png files by adding the flag `--png` when training, at the expense of slower load times.

The above conversion command creates images which match our experiments, where KITTI `.png` images were converted to `.jpg` on Ubuntu 16.04 with default chroma subsampling `2x2,1x1,1x1`.
We found that Ubuntu 18.04 defaults to `2x2,2x2,2x2`, which gives different results, hence the explicit parameter in the conversion command.

You can also place the KITTI dataset wherever you like and point towards it with the `--data_path` flag during training and evaluation.

**Splits**

The train/test/validation splits are defined in the `splits/` folder.
By default, the code will train a depth model using [Zhou's subset](https://github.com/tinghuiz/SfMLearner) of the standard Eigen split of KITTI, which is designed for monocular training.
You can also train a model using the new [benchmark split](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_depth.php?benchmark=depth_prediction) or the [odometry split](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_odometry.php) by setting the `--split` flag.
